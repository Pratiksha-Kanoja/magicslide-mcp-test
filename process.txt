ðŸª„ Steps to Add Your MCP to the Registry
1. Prepare your MCP project

Make sure your MagicSlide MCP repo has:

A clear README.md (what it does, install/run instructions, example config).

A license file (open-source is preferred).

Versioning (tag a release if possible).

2. Fork the MCP Registry

Go to the official MCP Registry repo
.

Click Fork (top right).

Clone your fork locally.

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/registry.git
cd registry

3. Add your MCP entry

In the servers/ (or appropriate category) folder of the registry, add a new JSON file describing your tool.
Example (magicslide.json):

{
  "name": "MagicSlide MCP",
  "description": "An MCP server for generating AI-powered slide decks.",
  "repo_url": "https://github.com/<your-username>/magicslide-mcp",
  "install": {
    "package": "pip install magicslide-mcp"
  },
  "tags": ["slides", "presentation", "AI"]
}


ðŸ“Œ The exact schema may vary â€” check the registry's README
 for the latest format.

4. Commit & push your changes
git add servers/magicslide.json
git commit -m "Add MagicSlide MCP to registry"
git push origin main

5. Open a Pull Request

Go to your fork on GitHub.

Click "New Pull Request".

Target the upstream mcp/registry repo.

Add a short description like "Add MagicSlide MCP to registry".

6. Review & merge

The maintainers will review your PR.

Once merged, your MagicSlide MCP will appear in github.com/mcp
 and become discoverable.
